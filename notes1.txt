Question 1.

What is ASL?
Answer.
According to Merriam-Webster dictionary ASL is a sign language that is used especially for communication by and with deaf people and is the formal sign Language of the United State and English-Speaking Canada and serves as the bass of various sign language in other countries. 
I believe that ASL is a language that uses physical and emotional expression to communicate. The language forms a bond between partners because during communication constant eye contact is required. ASL transcends other languages because it eliminated the need to speak (voice) to communicate.
Question 2.
 
What is Deaf Culture?
Answer.
Deaf Culture is the set of social beliefs, behaviors, art literacy tradition history values and shared institution and communities that are influenced by deafness and which use sign language at the main means of communication.
There was no formal deaf culture in Canada until the establishment of the first residential school for deaf students in 15 June 1831 in Quebec. The deaf culture meets the fives sociological criteria language (ASL for English speaking Canadians and LSQ for the French speaking), values (as the belief for one to be oneself), tradition, norms and identity. The deaf culture is a culture that allows people be themselves and to live in a way that is unique to them.
